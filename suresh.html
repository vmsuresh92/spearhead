    <p>The hosts and governing bodies of the World Cup, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the International Cricket Council (ICC), have decided to release tickets for non-India games before making India game tickets accessible. This approach, it is understood, arises from concerns that the ticketing website might experience crashes if online counters for all games are simultaneously opened. This potential issue largely stems from the immense demand for India's matches.</p>

<h2>'Baby AB' given a chance to grow up</h2>
<p>"I won't be calling him 'Baby AB'. We'll leave AB to be AB." Rob Walter delivered those no-nonsense words at a press conference on Monday (August 14) while sitting in front of a backdrop that looked like a wall stacked with toilet rolls.

    How apt. No dung would be flung, at least not by Walter, about Dewald Brevis' inclusion in South Africa's senior squad for the first time. Named in the T20I and ODI sides for home series against Australia starting on August 30, he would have to earn his keep like everyone else.</p>
